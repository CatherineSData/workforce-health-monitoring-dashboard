# 🩺 Workforce Risk & Health Overview Dashboard

> “What’s not visible can’t be managed.”  
> This dashboard was built to transform scattered data into strategic action.

## 🚀 About the Project

In today’s work environment, monitoring workforce health is not a luxury — it’s a critical need. This Power BI dashboard was developed for a mid-sized industrial company that struggled with siloed reports and limited insight into occupational health trends.

The result is a dynamic and interactive dashboard that consolidates key health and safety indicators into a single, clear visual narrative.

## 🧠 Real-World Impact

Prior to this solution, the company relied on static spreadsheets with little analytical value.

After implementing the dashboard:
- Supervisors identified that over 60% of lost days were concentrated in just two shifts.
- HR optimized preventive training programs based on the visual trends.
- Leadership launched targeted health initiatives in high-risk departments.

**This dashboard didn’t just show the data — it drove real action.**
